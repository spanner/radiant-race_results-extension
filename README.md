# Race Results

This extension was writting to process and display the results of races. It's written for fell races but it should work for any timed event, including those with intermediate checkpoints and the usual paraphernalia of clubs and categories. With a bit of minor updating it will also work for scored events, mountain marathons, relays and many other kinds of competition.

I don't expect it to be of much interest to other developers so I haven't given it much documentation: if you think you'd like to use it please let me know and I'll write it up properly.
