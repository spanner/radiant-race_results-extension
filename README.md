# Race Results

This extension was writting to process and display the results of fell races. It should work for any timed event, including those with intermediate checkpoints. I don't expect it to be of interest to anyone else so I haven't bothered much with documentation or convenience: if you think you'd like to use it please let me know and I'll write it up properly.
